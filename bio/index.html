        <h3>Early Years</h3>
        <p>
          I, Alexander Mitchell Nicoara, was born on April 8th, 1995 in Park
          Ridge, IL on a cold, rainy day. I lived in Elk Grove Village, IL
          with my parents, and was an only child until my brother entered
          the world 2 years later. From what I know from my parents, I had a
          lot of energy as a young child and liked to draw.

        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>
          As a gradeschool kid, I was ambitious and always hanging out around
          the neighborhood with friends.

        <h3>College Years</h3>
        <p>
          My college years included some of the best and worst moments of my
          life. School became difficult for me and pushed me to be at my best
          every day. While I had success early on, I experienced a bit of a slump
          in my grades late sophomore year. I realized that I had to make sacrifices
          so I could perform well in school, and so I made some to increase the
          amount of time I could spend on my schoolwork. This paid off, and
          I made the Dean's list with a near perfect GPA the following semester.
          While in college, I was also involved in some organizations and a sport.
          I was a distance runner for track and field for a semester, an active
          member of the Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity, and involved in Cru (a Christian
          campus ministry). Being involved really helped me grow and mature
          personally and helped me overcome social anxiety.

        <h3>Future</h3>
        <p>As I look into the future, I hope to get a job in Web Development. Web
           Development is something I really enjoy doing and learning about. I also
           want to travel and experience different parts of the world</p>
