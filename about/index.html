      <section id="introduction">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Alexander Nicoara. I am currently a 5th year Computer Science major at Illinois Institute of
          Technology specializing in Web Development. My hometown is Elk Grove Village, a northwest suburb of Chicago,
          but I currently reside in Chicago during the school year. While on campus, I am involved with Cru and my
          Fraternity (Phi Kappa Sigma). Both of these organizations have helped me grow professionally and personally,
          leading me to be more organized, social, and personable. As a student, I am enrolled in classes pertaining
          to web design, operating systems, probability/statistics, and graphics rendering protocol. I am eager to
          finish my last semester of school before heading off into the real world.</p>

        <h3>Mission</h3>
        <p>As a web developer, my mission is to produce graphically appealing and user-friendly websites/web-apps for
          customers. I tend to put myself into the user's shoes and try to examine their thought process as they are
          interacting with the web content. The design I choose must be simple for the user, easy to build upon, and
          secure for both the client and the host. I believe these 3 components are the key to creating a great
          website/web application. As a consumer myself, this is what I generally expect when browsing/interacting with
          a website/web-app.</p>

        <h3>Leisure</h3>
        <p>Aside of work and school, some of my hobbies are: traveling, playing sports, hanging out with friends, and
          coding. I am always up for a challenge, whether it's traveling somewhere new or tackling a challenging coding
          problem, because I enjoy the process of learning and experiencing something new. I also take leisure time
          very seriously, because too much stress can impact one's health negatively and put a person at risk for
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2568977/">further complications</a> as they get older.
          At the same time, too much leisure time can make a person lazy, and this could carry over to areas of life
          where they can't have that mindset (such as work). Finding a good balance is key to staying in good mental
          health, and that's a personal standard that I have for myself.</p>
